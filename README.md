Amazon Electronics Review Analysis and Recommendation System

Analyzed Amazon Electronics Reviews dataset by pre-processing data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing text to derive insights and trends.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify top and least reviewed brands, most positively reviewed products, and yearly review distributions. Created visualizations such as word clouds and pie charts for comprehensive insights.
Implemented text preprocessing techniques including HTML tag removal, accented character normalization, acronym expansion, special character removal, and lemmatization to prepare data for analysis.
Built and evaluated machine learning models (Bag of Words, TF-IDF) and collaborative filtering recommenders (user-user and item-item) using K-fold validation to predict ratings and recommend products, reporting precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
